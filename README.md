# sifnode

Sifchain is the omni-chain solution for DEXs. More performant, more robust crypto-economics for trading and security, more flexible trading capabilities, an extensible omni-chain roadmap, and eventual true DAO governance.

Built using the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, and generated with [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport).

## Getting Started

You can set up sifnode as a standalone (compile and run on your own hardware/VPS) node or you can set up sifnode on kubernetes on AWS.

### Standalone
