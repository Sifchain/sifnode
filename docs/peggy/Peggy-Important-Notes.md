# Important Notes

Due to the current version of peggy in alphanet, there has not been time to implement all the needed features and prevent all possible corner cases.

As such, use this software with small amounts of cryptocurrency at your own risk.

# Unlocking Eth To Smart Contracts

Due to the given constraints of peggy, we are NOT allowing peggy to unlock funds and send them to a smart contract.

When you burn ceth on sifchain, you cannot specify a smart contract address or else your smart contract will most likely not receive these ether.
